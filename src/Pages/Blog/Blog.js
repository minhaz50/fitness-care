          <p>
            The Fit Bottomed world is run by fitness professionals Jennipher
            Walters and Kristen Seymour. The two friends started Fit Bottomed
            Girls in 2008 as they were looking for a fresh approach to health
            and fitness without the dieting. The blog has been growing ever
            since and has now expanded into other verticals such as Fit Bottomed
            Mammas, the Fit Bottomed Girls Podcast, and the online course Love
            Your Body. Love Your Life. The blog was launched as a way to solve a
            problem; they were looking for a new way to be healthy. Just months
            after starting, readers latched on and related to the content almost
            immediately.
